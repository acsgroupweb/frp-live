Fink Roberts & Petrie was pleased to have structural engineering firm Lawson Elser join FRP at the end of 2022.  For 33 years, Indianapolis based Lawson Elser provided structural design services on a wide range of building types throughout Indiana and surrounding states.

Lawson Elser shared many of the same clients as FRP, and like FRP was known for its expertise and commitment to quality structural engineering and project management services. The firm brought to FRP its design expertise, history of successful projects, and client relationships.

FRP was pleased to welcome Brian Elser, P.E., Dwain Hendershot, P.E., and Ben Lengerich, P.E. to the FRP team. Mike Lawson, P.E., also continued to work for a period of time as a consultant. Their contributions at FRP have further strengthened our engineering expertise and client service.
