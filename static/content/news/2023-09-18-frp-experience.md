Fï»¿RP strives to apply the combined experience of its engineers and designers on every project.  This happens through collaboration during project design and construction phases, and through regular review and updating of office design and detailing methods and standards.  Last week we captured this photo of a group of our engineers and designers working through a review of FRP's wood project standards.  This is the type of dedication and collaboration that makes FRP a great company, for growth and success of our staff and for quality service for our clients!
