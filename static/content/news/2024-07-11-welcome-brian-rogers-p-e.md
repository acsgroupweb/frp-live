FRP is excited to introduce and welcome our newest employee, Brian Rogers. Brian started at FRP as a Project Engineer in June. 

Brian graduated from Purdue University with his BSCE in 2018. He completed his MSCE at UCLA in 2019. Brian is a registered professional engineer and has five years of experience in varying types and sizes of projects. Brian jumped in on a few projects and we are looking forward to utilizing his expertise. In Brianâ€™s free time he enjoys hanging out with friends, playing pickup ball sports, enjoying nature, traveling, and adventure sports (skiing, surfing, mountain biking, and rock climbing). Congratulations and welcome Brian!
